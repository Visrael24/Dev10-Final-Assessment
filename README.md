<h1> StarSharks README </h1>


This document outlines the StarSharks' final project, including an [introduction and overview of the project](#introduction), steps on [how to navigate the folders](#repository-structure) in this Github Repository, a [walk through of our data processing](#etl), and what [technologies we used](#technologies-used).

## Introduction
As our final project, our team sought to investigate trends in global fish consumption, looking at how a country's consumption may be impacted by its production and the availability of other protein sources, and how its consumption may affect the overall life expectancy in the country. 

The primary questions we looked to answer in this investigation were:
1. Is there a correlation between fish consumption and production in a country?
2. How much do countries depend on fish for sustenance?
3. It's said that eating fish leads to healthier lives, is this true?

## Repository Structure


The folders in this repository consist of:

[Data](/Data/), a folder holding the CSV files which we used to perform our data analysis.

[Workspaces](/Workspaces/), a folder containing our individual workspaces, where we carried out work in python notebooks.
- [Becca's Workspace](/Workspaces/Becca_workspace/)
- [Jesse's Workspace](/Workspaces/Jesses_workspace/)
- [Val's Workspace](/Workspaces/Vals_workspace/)

I was not able to report any clouds or haze in the sky. I spotted the 15 wide soft glow of the Gegenschein without even looking for it while it was only 40 up in between the Sickle of Leo and M44 in Cancer. I believe I might have just caught a glimpse of a magnitude +6.9 star below Betelgeuse, but cant be certain because of how distractingly bright Betelgeuse was. However, I have proven that on the best nights, I can see stars as faint as magnitude +7.0 overhead. Ive also proven that the galaxy M81 in Ursa Major is visible with the naked eye on those aforementioned nights. I like to say that I live under high quality Bortle Class 3 skies.","As for other aspects of my observing sight, I live out in the rural where the nearest yard lights are a half mile to my N, NW, and N. From where I observe I am only 15 feet from my house and have about 40 of my western horizon blocked by it and nearby trees. I also have forests covering a chunk of the horizon from the N to the E and all the way S (though the trees come nearest to me in the NE and SE). This is actually a good thing though, since as the nearest cities are in those directions (NNE, E, SE), the worst of their light pollution is blocked from my eyes. The biggest nearby city and thus my worst light-pollution dome is the one 21 miles to the SSE. Its a noticeable nuisance because there is some good stuff to the south.

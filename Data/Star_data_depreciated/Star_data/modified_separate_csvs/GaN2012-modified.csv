Duraj Cleveland State PHY202 CSU#:2710    The clouds around 7 o'clock on Friday night, are believed to be of the stratus type, since they were very flaky, spanned out, and lower to the ground as compared to other cloud formations. In terms of the direction they were moving, however, it seemed as if, from my location on the front stoop of my porch, they were moving North. Also, about a quarter of the sky was filled with the haze of the sky and clouds, but details, not lacking in the least bit, were gathered about the night sky. For example, as I looked to the west, a faint glow was present in the night sky, but it was not being emitted from any particular object. After further investigation, it was learned that this glow in the western sky, about two hours after sunset, was the zodiacal light, being shone from the interplanetary dust. I found this rather interesting due to the fact that this light was not necessarily being produced by solidified objects in our space, but rather than the entire environment those objects inhabit.","My location is rather dark, as to compared to other locations in the city in which I reside. When saying lit, I mean there are more streetlights active on other streets than my own; along with porchlights that flood the narrow avenues, that can possibly hold an effect on viewing the nightsky on Friday, March 4th. So, my location was rather ideal, taking my suburban location into account, to view the sky. Which was very possible, with more than a quarter of the sky and its' inhabitants viewable--cloud types, directions, viewable light, haze and glow.",United States - Ohio,44125

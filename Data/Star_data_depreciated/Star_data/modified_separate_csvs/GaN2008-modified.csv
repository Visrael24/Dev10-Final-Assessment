It was better than on some nights when the ball park (local city field) lights up the sky.  With 15x70 binoculars the sky was a treat. Lots of good viewing in Orion and the nebulae stood out very well. I guess that is outside of this study but it still provides a treat even with Magnitude 4 skies.,For this area it was pretty good viewing. The seeing was OK but not spectacular. There were a lot of lights from the local neiborhood that may have affected what could be seen at that time of night - better after midnight.,United States - Washington,98042

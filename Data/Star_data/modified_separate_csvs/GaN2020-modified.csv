The State has significant snowfall during the Winters, and moderate-high levels of rainfall in the Spring and the Fall given the respective climate zone. And, as an Ag state, the air pollution tends to be higher than other low density States due to Nitrate particulates. The State largely is very close to Sea Level, with areas that are below sea level.  This location represents the highest land levels in the State.

There are porch lights and lights from houses that create some interference. I also notice tv light flickers creating interference. There is a family's motion activated porch light nearby turning on and off and it actually knocks out a couple of the stars I can see every time.     It was initially  difficult to make out Cygnus because the shape of the star clusters keeps changing, but I definitely see some of it. I know I could see more with even just a tad less light.    I can make out Cassiopeia clearly and distinctly without using an app to see the shape due to the brightness. When I cross reference the  app with Cassiopeia, I can see all of its stars with the naked eye.    This may be due to the fact that from my view, there are no houses and only the forest below the location giving off light.

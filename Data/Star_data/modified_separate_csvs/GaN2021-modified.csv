Sky was clear overhead as darkness set in but with advancing haze and very thin high clouds from the west that eventually reached the zenith and beyond. There were, however, significant periods of clearer and open gaps in the haze and high cloudiness that allowed for direct observation of fainter stars.  First magnitude stars (Sirius, Procyon, Betelgeuse, Rigel, Capella, Aldebaran, etc.) to the SW and W appeared by 20:15. Arcturus was prominent low in the ENE. In the wider target location of Leo Regulus and Denebola were also apparent. After that, the major stars of Leo gradually became visible, with a number of attendant stars visible by 20:45. By session's end (21:00) such stars as 31 Leonis (mag. 4.5) and delta (mag. 4.1) and gamma (mag. 4.6) Cancri were visible directly, but averted vision made them more obvious. The asterism known as the Head of Hydra was visible (mags. 3.5-4.6) as well. As in the last observation made at the site (9/11/20) there was ""sky glow (sodium light orange) to NE and E up to c. 30 degrees above horizon."" Lesser sky glow was evident to SE, S and SW. To the W, however, an unshielded, blue-white, high mast beacon glared inescapably above the treeline from Skyward Dr. There were additional bright fixtures lower down in that direction. Actual sky glow to W and NW was not obtrusive but was somewhat more evident to the N. There was also considerable ambient light at ground level generated from street and building lighting along an adjacent road (West Ave.) to NE, E and SE.","This observation took place at Pitney Meadows Community Farm, a semi-suburban site c. 1 mile to the SW of the densely lit urban core of Saratoga Springs, NY and to the NW of Saratoga Spa State Park.

There were an abundant amount of tress around the vicinity. There were  approximately 15. The trees are large and take up much space.

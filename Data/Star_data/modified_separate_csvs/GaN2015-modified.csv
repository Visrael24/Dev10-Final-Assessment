In this Activity, I was looking forward to learning how to identify a certain constellation, in this case, the constellation of Orion. From my roof, Orion was surprisingly easy to locate. The clear sky was perfect for observing. I visited this website before going on the roof, and I was able to gain an idea of what exactly I was looking for. The 3 stars that make up ""Orion's Belt"" were not too hard to find. After finding those, I looked for  Betelgeuse, located above the belt, and found it.

I tried to observe from last night (03/18/2015) around the same time, but since it had just rained there was only cloud cover and no visibility of the stars.  I also tried to observe from my own home which was more northwest of my actual observing location.  I observed from just outside my workplace.  The stars were not as bright as I had hoped.  Although there was no cloud cover, there was very little visibility of the stars.  I was able to use a separate application as well to help me locate what I was looking for and which way to look because it was difficult to see any stars.  I watched the sky for about an hour to see if visibility would get better and it did not.","urban area about 4 street lights just past the highway off of Hampden and Santa Fe (two very big streets)  observation made from 24 Hour Fitness Englewood location, street corner",United States - Colorado,80110
